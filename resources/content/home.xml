		</entrytitle>
		<content> 
			<span>Phew! Just released <b>Zcms 1.1!</b>. Finally I've added comments support. There are many bugs and limitations.. you are warned</span>
			<br />
			<span>Changelog:</span>
			<br />
				<li>added analize_config_post() for analize config after adding the content</li>
				<li>added support for aligning elements horizontally (useful with fixed positioned elements)</li>
				<li>initial support for comments</li>
			<br />
			<span>Known issues: </span>
			<br />
			<li>comments are not correctly hidden</li>
			<li>comments are read-only for now (server implementation of zcms is still non-existent)</li>
			<li>I don&#39;t know if comment&#39;s protocol should be rewrited, deleted or kept as it is now... 
			 using only posts, which can eventually be replies of other posts, seems a better and simpler idea</li>
			 <li>comments' animation doesn't work</li>
			 <li>comments are not loaded correctly when 2 or more entries are shown (ajax overlapping)</li>
