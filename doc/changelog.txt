////// Neilos 1.4 2012-08-05 //////
-New PHP Core 
-MySQL Support
-Rewrite of the plugin infrastructure. Now plugins are loaded with xml with <plugin> tag.
-New Loader plugin. Server side loading of subentries is now possible
-tags support (sql only for the moment)
-basic admin tools (clean database, convert   files <--> database)

-title config is now called pagetitle. <title> is not anymore an html content like <content>. It is a config.
	This is means that the title is a string only and cannot contain html stuff.

////// Neilos 1.3 2012-04-23 //////
-brand new server side plugin infrastructure
-added the 'more' plugin
-added a class config for adding additional classes to entries
-added a click config which opens an internal link when an entry is clicked

-configs of entries with the same id are now merged

////// Neilos 1.2.2 2012-04-17 //////
-added a load.php that load an alternative (very minimal ATM!) version of the site. Used with google bot.. A proper index.php is required to load the script
-title support in config. Used for changing the page title
-the extension if the content files is not necessary anymore. It is guessed by the core

////// Neilos 1.2.1 2012-01-03 //////
Every div created from config has an additional container
Animations are loaded serially. No more glitching.
It is now possible to specify animation speed in ms using speed="#1000"
hide and show animations settings can be set individually 
Title of entries can be ignored using <type>notitle</type> in config
Documentation updated

////// Zcms 1.2 2011-12-29 //////
added a very basic documentation updated to Zcms 1.1.2, so it's quite useless ATM ^_^
there is no more distinction between posts and comments, they're all entries
added support for loading subentries and entry's content only when the they are shown
Most configs are now inheritable to subentries
Now entries behaviour can be set. Available modes are: show everything, hide everything, and show only the first entry
the homepage is not hardcoded anymore. It can be set in the config
minor changes
KNOWN ISSUE: Using slide animation will probanly produce glitching, use fade instead 
 
////// Zcms 1.1.2 2011-11-28 //////
-deprecation of old functions: xml2string
-add support for loading php or html files. 
-<load_xml> and add_xml() have been renamed to <load_file> and add_file()
-the title element has been renamed to 'entrytitle' for a php incompatibility

KNOWN ISSUE: comments in the non-first articles are not shown... 

////// Zcms 1.1.1 2011-09-08 //////
-comments are hidden correctly when the parent's post is hidden
-all comments are loaded correctly now

////// Zcms 1.1 2011-09-07 //////
-added analize_config_post() for analize config after adding the content
-added support for aligning elements horizontally (useful with fixed positioned elements)
-initial support for comments

Known issues:
-comments are not correctly hidden
-comments are read-only for now (server implementation of zcms is still non-existent)
-I don't know if comment's protocol should be rewrited, deleted or kept as it is now... 
 using only posts, which can eventually be replies of other posts, seems a better and simpler idea
-comments' animation doesn't work
-comments are not loaded correctly when 2 or more entries are shown (ajax overlapping)

////// Zcms 1.0.3 2011-09-06 //////
-fixed animation (added an additional subdiv to every structure divs)
-added more animations. Now you can choose between fade,slide and hide(default)
-added subdiv 'text_right'
-support for date and author (tag 'author' and 'date' for css styling)
-support for showing/hiding entries. By default, first entry is shown, others are hidden

////// Zcms 1.0.2 2011-09-05 //////
-animations are loaded serially (better stability)
-class names clean up (no more tons of useless classes inside the same div)
-the first entry now has an additional 'firstentry' class for more css fun
-xml tags has better names now (tab --> title, container --> entry)
-added a little parser that substitutes variables in the text entries

////// Zcms 1.0.1 ~ 2011-09-02 //////
-support for multiple posts, instead of the classic single page
-now xml pages are retrieved serially (better reliability)
-code clean up
