////// Zcms 1.1.1 2011-09-08 //////
-comments are hidden correctly when the parent's post is hidden
-all comments are loaded correctly now

////// Zcms 1.1 2011-09-07 //////
-added analize_config_post() for analize config after adding the content
-added support for aligning elements horizontally (useful with fixed positioned elements)
-initial support for comments

Known issues:
-comments are not correctly hidden
-comments are read-only for now (server implementation of zcms is still non-existent)
-I don't know if comment's protocol should be rewrited, deleted or kept as it is now... 
 using only posts, which can eventually be replies of other posts, seems a better and simpler idea
-comments' animation doesn't work
-comments are not loaded correctly when 2 or more entries are shown (ajax overlapping)

////// Zcms 1.0.3 2011-09-06 //////
-fixed animation (added an additional subdiv to every structure divs)
-added more animations. Now you can choose between fade,slide and hide(default)
-added subdiv 'text_right'
-support for date and author (tag 'author' and 'date' for css styling)
-support for showing/hiding entries. By default, first entry is shown, others are hidden

////// Zcms 1.0.2 2011-09-05 //////
-animations are loaded serially (better stability)
-class names clean up (no more tons of useless classes inside the same div)
-the first entry now has an additional 'firstentry' class for more css fun
-xml tags has better names now (tab --> title, container --> entry)
-added a little parser that substitutes variables in the text entries

////// Zcms 1.0.1 ~ 2011-09-02 //////
-support for multiple posts, instead of the classic single page
-now xml pages are retrieved serially (better reliability)
-code clean up


////// Zcms 1.0 ~ 2011-03 //////
-First release
